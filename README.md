##There is nothing complicated in life. We are complicated. Life is a simple thing, and what is simpler in it is more correct. (c) Oscar Wilde

Why?
How can you apply an algorithm without knowing how it works. Writing an algorithm helps me to understand all the nuances of its work, as well as in the next solution of the problem, you will see why it is good to apply one or another algorithm since you fully know their work
